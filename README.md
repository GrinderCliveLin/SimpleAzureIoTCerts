# Use X.509 Certificates to Authenticate with Azure IoT Hub

SimpleAzureIoTCerts is a C#-based command-line application that demonstrates how to authenticate with Azure IoT Hub using self-generated and self-signed X.509 certificates.

You can learn more about Azure IoT Hub authentication on the [Control access to IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security#supported-x509-certificates) page located on the Azure documentation website.

## What's included?

SimpleAzureIoTCerts implements two key features:
* Add Device
  * Registers a new device with Azure IoT Hub
  * Gives you the option of associating X.509 certificates (primary and secondary) with a device at time of registration in three different ways. Our goal is to give you patterns that you can clone into your own implementation. 
    * Embedded: The build process embeds X.509 certificates into the SimpleAzureIoTCerts binary.  The "Resources" folders contains the CRT and PFX files that will be included.
    * Bundled: The build process copies standalone X.509 certificate files we've pre-generated into the same directory the SimpleAzureIoTCerts binary is output into.  You can then specify these files by name during runtime when prompted for certificate filenames: primary.crt, primary.pfx, secondary.crt, secondary.pfx.
    * Bring Your Own: Instead of using the pre-generated certificates files (CRT, PFX) we've described above, you can use OpenSSL to generate your own.  
* Delete (all) Devices - Deletes the first 1000 devices in an IoT Hub Registry.  This is particularly useful if you need to quickly delete all the devices in your registry.

## Setup a development environment

* Clone this GitHub repository.
* Install Visual Studio 2015.  Don't have it?  Download the free [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
* Optionally, install OpenSSL.  Don't want to?  No worries.  We've included self-generated and self-signed X.509 certificates that you can use to get started.
  * NOTE: Don't use any of these certifcates in a production or quasi-production (i.e. QA) environment!  They're here so you can focus on understanding the authentication flow between your client app / device, the Azure IoT NuGet packages, and IoT Hub - and not the particulars of OpenSSL.  

## Create an Azure IoT Hub 

* Sign in to the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com
* Create a new IoT Hub 
* Wait for the deployment of your new IoT Hub to complete.  
* Navigate to your IoT Hub Instance -> Settings / Shared access policies -> iothubowner
* Copy the value associated with "Connection string--primary key". It should come in this format:
  * HostName=your-iot-hub-name.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=AzureGeneratedGUID

## Build and Run SimpleAzureIoTCerts

* Open the cloned code from this repository in Visual Studio
* Update the variable azIotConnectionString in Program.cs with the value of "Connection string--primary key", which you copied from the Azure Portal
  * Or, leave this value empty and provide it at the command line like so: 
    * SimpleAzureIoTCerts <connection string>
* Optionally, you can supply the "Connection string--primary key" value when prompted by SimpleAzureIoTCerts
* Build and run the app: SimpleAzureIoTCerts
* Follow the prompts to add a new device and select which X.509 certificates you want to use.
  * Want to use your own certificates?  Follow the instructions in the section below.

## (Optional) Self-Generate and Self-Sign X.509 Certificates with OpenSSL 

It's easy to generate, sign, and supply your own X.509 certs to SimpleAzureIoTCerts.
* This command generates a "primary" cert with output of primary.crt and primary.pfx
  * openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout primary.key -x509 -days 365 -out primary.crt
  * openssl pkcs12 -export -out primary.pfx -inkey primary.key -in primary.crt 
* This command generates a "secondary" cert with output of secondary.crt and secondary.pfx
  * openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout secondary.key -x509 -days 365 -out secondary.crt
  * openssl pkcs12 -export -out secondary.pfx -inkey secondary.key -in secondary.crt
